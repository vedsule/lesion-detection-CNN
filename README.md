# lesion-detection-CNN
Use CNN to detect lesion in mammograms <br>
This model can be used in conjunction with Unet-Mammograms as a validation layers <br>
Unet-Mammogram was made on : CBIS dataset  <br>
Drawback of CBIS dataset : it does not have lots of cropped images  <br>
<br>
This Model is made on : Histopathology dataset <br>
It has lots of cropped images and thus results in imporoved lesion charecterization <br>
